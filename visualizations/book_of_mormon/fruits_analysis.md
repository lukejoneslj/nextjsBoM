1. **Christ-Centered Focus**:
- The Book of Mormon shows a strong Christ-centered focus, with high scores in this category
- This aligns with the New Testament's emphasis on Christ as the central figure
- The consistent Christ-centered messaging throughout the text suggests a unified purpose

2. **Dignity and Respect**:
- The Book of Mormon maintains high dignity scores
- The language and treatment of individuals and groups shows respect
- This aligns with Christian principles of treating others with dignity

3. **Moral Standards**:
- The Book of Mormon consistently demonstrates high moral standards
- The moral teachings align with biblical principles
- The text emphasizes virtuous living and ethical behavior

4. **Internal Consistency**:

Based on these measurable fruits, the Book of Mormon appears to demonstrate characteristics that would be considered "good fruit" according to Matthew 7's criteria. It shows consistency in its Christ-centered focus, maintains high moral standards, and promotes principles that align with biblical teachings.

However, it's important to note that this is just one aspect of evaluation. As with any spiritual text, personal study, prayer, and spiritual confirmation are also essential components in determining its truth and value.
