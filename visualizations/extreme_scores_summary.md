## Limitations of the Analysis

### Methodological Limitations
- **Quantitative vs. Qualitative**: The analysis reduces complex spiritual content to numerical scores, which cannot capture the full depth and nuance of religious texts
- **Chapter-Level Granularity**: Scoring at the chapter level may miss important variations within chapters
- **Score Definitions**: The definitions of "dignity," "Christ-centered," and "moral" scores are based on specific criteria that may not fully align with all theological interpretations
- **Cultural Context**: The analysis may not fully account for historical and cultural contexts that influence the meaning of texts

### Technical Limitations
- **NLP Constraints**: Natural Language Processing has limitations in understanding spiritual and metaphorical language
- **Translation Effects**: The analysis is performed on English translations, which may not capture nuances present in original languages
- **Algorithm Bias**: The scoring algorithms may have inherent biases based on their training data
- **Invitation Focus**: The analysis primarily focuses on chapter invitations rather than the full content of chapters

### Interpretive Limitations
- **Spiritual Dimensions**: The analysis cannot measure spiritual truth or divine inspiration
- **Historical Context**: The analysis does not account for the historical context in which texts were written
- **Theological Complexity**: Complex theological concepts may be oversimplified in the scoring process
- **Personal Revelation**: The analysis cannot account for personal spiritual experiences and revelations

### Purpose and Application
This analysis is intended as a supplementary tool for study and comparison, not as a definitive measure of the spiritual value or truth of these texts. The scores should be considered alongside traditional methods of scripture study, including prayer, meditation, and guided by the Holy Spirit.
