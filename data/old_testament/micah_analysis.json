      "invitation": "The chapter invites the reader to acknowledge the consequences of sin and turn away from wickedness. It also calls for lamentation and mourning over the destruction and captivity that result from disobedience.",
      "rationalization": "The language, while direct in its condemnation, does not explicitly dehumanize or incite violence, meriting a dignity score of 5. The text focuses on judgment against sin and does not directly mention Christ or his redemptive work, resulting in a low score for Christ-centeredness. The chapter strongly condemns sinful behavior like idolatry and corruption and therefore receives a high moral score. The invitation comes from the LORD's perspective, encouraging the people to change their ways.",

      "rationalization": "The language, while direct and powerful, criticizes actions rather than extending dignity to all. It condemns the actions of leaders and prophets, portraying them in a negative light. The chapter lays the groundwork for the coming of Christ by calling for repentance of sins. It strongly promotes moral principles by condemning exploitation and corruption and warning of consequences. Micah clearly presents a vision of a righteous society and a rejection of evil.",

      "rationalization": "The language used in Micah 4 is largely aspirational, depicting a future of peace and universal worship, suggesting a high dignity score. While not explicitly mentioning Jesus, the chapter foreshadows concepts of gathering, redemption, and a future kingdom, tying into Christ-centered ideas. The text strongly promotes virtuous living through its emphasis on peace, justice, and the worship of God, meriting a high moral score. The invitation is clear, offering hope and encouraging faith in the face of hardship.",

      "rationalization": "The language is primarily descriptive and prophetic, focusing on God's actions and promises, earning a 6 for dignity. It's strongly Christ-centered, with the prophecy of the ruler's birth in Bethlehem (verse 2), pointing directly to Jesus, thus a score of 8. The text promotes moral behavior through warnings against idolatry and calls for dependence on God's strength. The overall moral guidance earns an 8.",
