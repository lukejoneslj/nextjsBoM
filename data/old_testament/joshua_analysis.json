      "rationalization": "Dignity is present through respectful commands from Joshua, but lacks a focus on human value beyond the immediate task. The text indirectly points to Christ by prefiguring the crossing of the Jordan as a type of baptism and new beginning. It teaches strong moral principles such as obedience, trust, and reverence for God's power and promises, encouraging virtuous living.

The chapter prefigures aspects of Christianity through circumcision as a covenant and the appearance of a divine figure, indirectly relating to Christ (Christ-centered score: 4). The chapter emphasizes obedience, following God's commands, and proper worship, which encourages virtuous living (moral score: 8).

The text does not explicitly mention Christ, but does reference God and the covenant. The actions are morally driven with an emphasis on obedience to God.

      "rationalization": "The language, while straightforward, describes a violent act of stoning and burning, lowering the dignity score. There is indirect reference to Christian principles like sin, confession, and judgment, so a mid-range Christ-centered score. The chapter strongly emphasizes moral teachings related to obedience, honesty, and the consequences of sin, which boosts the moral score.

There are no direct references to Christ or Christian principles, making the score low (3).

The Christ-centered score is very low as it makes no mention of Christ or his teachings. The moral score is moderate as it highlights obedience to God and the fulfillment of his commands, but the means (violence) are ethically problematic by today's standards.
