      "rationalization": "The language is highly dignified, using respectful terms like 'beloved brother' and appealing to love rather than coercion. It is deeply Christ-centered, explicitly mentioning Jesus Christ and drawing on Christian principles of forgiveness and reconciliation. The chapter promotes strong moral teachings by urging compassion, kindness, humility, and seeking to repay debts. The author appeals to love, faith, and the example of Christ, making it a model of ethical persuasion and relationship repair.",
