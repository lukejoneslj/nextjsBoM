      "invitation": "The chapter invites the reader to earnestly contend for their faith and to remain steadfast in their beliefs, avoiding false teachers and embracing virtuous living.",
      "rationalization": "The language, while strong, is primarily focused on warning against specific behaviors and false teachers, but doesn't descend into dehumanization. The text frequently references Jesus Christ and his role in salvation. The chapter strongly emphasizes ethical conduct, warning against ungodly deeds and encouraging believers to live righteously. Although Jude does not attempt to be a neutral observer, he offers a warning to those who are at risk.",
